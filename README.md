# Key Moon

![Key Moon](public/keymoon.png)

Key Moon is a simple Persian-first tool for locking and unlocking text with a key. You paste your text, encode it, and later decode it with the same key. If you leave the key empty, the app uses a default key that rotates periodically for safety—so for reliable access, set your own custom key.

## How it works (non-technical)

- Enter your text in the Encode tab and (optionally) add your own key.
- The app turns it into a safe-looking Persian-letter output you can share or store.
- To read it again, paste the encoded text in Decode and use the same key.
